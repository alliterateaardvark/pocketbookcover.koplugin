# KOReader Pocketbook Cover

This is a fork of cklib's original. This version preserves the aspect ratio of the book cover with black bars, whereas the original stretches the cover to fit the screen.

## Installation

Simply copy the folder *pocketbookcover.koplugin* to */applications/koreader/plugins* on your PocketBook device.
To use the book cover on the sleep screen, create the following directory on your device if it does not already exist: */mnt/ext1/system/resources/Line*

## Usage

After you've installed the KOReader plugin, syncing the book cover will happen silently.
Please note this is only affects "Power-Off logo" option. It won't affect the "Boot logo" option.
